# Sound Localization

## Project Goals
* Show the locations (people) sound is being emitted from
* Seperate out the sound that is coming from each location
* The sound locations may be standing, walking, or running.
* The accuracy should ideally be a couple feet. Testing has indicated accuracy of a few hundredths of a second, or around 30 feet. 

## Project Resources
* Common Sound recordings at different locations
* These sound recordings may move around, and may need to be synched
* Typically should expect the recordings to be standing at walking speed.

## Project Hints
* The allowance for movement means the frequencies may be off by 1-2%. Environmental impacts may also impact this if they change with time.
* Perhaps different sound types can play a role. Look up human speech patterns.
* Environmental effects on sound amplitudes from environmental impacts may be substantial. Environmental impacts on the timing is likely to be small.
